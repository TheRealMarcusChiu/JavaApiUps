1. you will need to sign-up for UPS and to get 4 credentials in order to use their APIs
   - username
   - password
   - access key
   - account number (also known as shipping number)

2. create own personal build.properties to place your 4 credentials
   - first find your computer username via command "whoami"
   - then create a file under the same directory as build.properties with name $(whoami)_build.properties
   - in that file paste the following and fill in the blanks

   accesskey=gibberish
   username=gibberish
   password=gibberish
   accountnumber=gibberish

2. UPS has given you 3 things:
   - build.xml
   - build.properties
   - and the .xsd files located in /src/main/resources/xsd

2. we will need a couple jar files
   - jaxb-core-$(version).jar
   - jaxb-impl-$(version).jar
   - jaxb-jxc-$(version).jar
   - jaxb-xjc-$(version).jar

   - I have placed them in /jars/jaxb
   - Also make sure the build.properties have "jaxb.home=jars/jaxb" like so

   - to get those jar files you could uncomment the dependencies within the pom.xml
   - then execute "mvn clean install" on terminal
   - go to ~/.m2/repository folder and locate those jars and copy them into /jars/jaxb

3. run Apache Ant on the build.xml
   ~> ant

   This will create the UPS java classes used to run the JaxbShipConfirmClient.java
   these java classes will be placed in /src/main/java/com/ups/xolt/codesamples as specified in the build.properties
